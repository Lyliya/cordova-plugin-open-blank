title: Open Blank Links
description: Open Blank an in-app browser window.

This plugin intercepts all redirects and opens them in the in-app-browser (Android) or Safari (iOS).
Useful to show e.g. videos in iframes (which requires allow-navigation) and still intercepting all redirects
to a whitelisted navigation target.

**NOTE: you should at least test iframes from youtube AND vimeo, as a naive implementation will only work for one of them**
